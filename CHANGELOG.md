# stream2own 5.0.0 (Rebrand)

## Monorepo with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)

## Introducing embed app

Embed app is a minimalist version of beta app.

It displays random and individual tracks as well as artists tracks and some recent labels albums.

Authentication is not enabled.

## Postcss instead of scss

It's more a note for those who got involved in pre open-source development. We now use postcss instead of scss.

## All `@resonate` NPM packages are now available in our new monorepo inside `/packages/**/*`

Some packages got republished with different names. Hence `@resonate/player-component` instead of `@resonate/player`.

Our NPM org has now public packages enabled.

All prior versions of packages are now deprecated.
